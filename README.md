# Enemy Template
# ==============

## Welcome
### ---------------

Hello I am Avien I am a Dev of the [OopsAllLemurians](https://thunderstore.io/package/OopsAllLemurians/) Team. Recently Mint was trying to find out a way with to make enemies in ROR2. It took about 3 days to get  things working at a basic level. We do plan on improving upon this Template  until it reaches all areas of what we find is needs in creating enemies (can be found under Plans for the Future below). I, Avien, will be mantaining the Enemy Template. I am in the Risk of Rain 2 Modding discord server, my name is Avien (OopsAllLemurians Team) in the server.

## Recommendations
### -------------------------

- Have experience with making skills.
- Have used Robs Template before, if not its okay.

## Features

- Can have multiple enemies in the same project
- Currently allows for spawning of normal enemies
- Have control over which maps enemies spawn in
- Have control over enemies stats
- Fast setup out of the gate

## Plans for the future

- Add handling Bosses
- Add handling MiniBosses
- Add handling Elites?

## How it works/Setup

Most of what you need to do is similar to [Henerymod Template](https://github.com/ArcPh1r3/HenryTutorial) with some diffrences.
### Step 1, setting up the model in unity

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.
